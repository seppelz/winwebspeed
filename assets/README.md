# Assets Directory

Place your application icon here:

- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file for the application and system tray
  - Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 pixels
  - You can create this using online tools like:
    - https://convertio.co/png-ico/
    - https://www.icoconverter.com/
    - Or use image editing software like GIMP or Photoshop

For now, the application will use a default empty icon if this file is missing.
